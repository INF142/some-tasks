# Files for some of the tasks for the group sessions

Here you can find some of the files given for certain tasks for the group session, for instance, Python scripts, templates, skeletons of scripts, etc. All these files will be also available on Mitt.UiB. Hence, cloning this repo is absolutely optional. We will appreciate any feedback about this repo and you can make a pull request correcting minor issues like typos.

## How to use?

- Clone the repo.
- Create a branch for your work.
- Pull before each group session or lab.
- Merge or rebase to your branch.
- Work on the tasks in your branch.

## Should every student use this?

No. This is meant for students who feel comfortable enough with git. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to assist students having issues here, for instance, when rebasing. Students with little proficient in git are encouraged to learn it, but, for the moment, they should simply download the files from Mitt.UiB.
